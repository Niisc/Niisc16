## Documentation

To properly make use of this project it is recommended  to read the included documentation pdf (Niisc.pdf). A compiler and an assembler are included so is a gui program to better view and understand instructions.<br/>
The save file for the logic simulator / game "turing complete" is included, the verilog save is included as well.<br/>

## Compiler and Assembler
Provided toolchain to be used in junction with the logic simulation. Both are a work in progress.
#### 1) Compiler
The compiler will *compile* C-Like code to assembly, after which it can be assembled using the provided assembler.

#### 2) Assembler
The assembler can be used to assemble code produced by the compiler or to assemble assembly code written by the user.
